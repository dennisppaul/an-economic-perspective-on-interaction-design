this document aims to present economic models for earning money as a designer ( or as an artist for that matter ). if you find anything missing or wrong, please file an [issue](https://github.com/dennisppaul/an-economic-perspective-on-interaction-design/issues) or send a message to d.paul@hfk-bremen.de

although the focus is intentionally put on interaction design a lot of these points below also apply of course to other design disciplines as well as new media art and other art forms.

this document aims to present economic models for earning money as a designer. some models assume that design is practiced as intended by the discipline ( e.g working for clients, selling works ), while others rather aim to apply design skills in other areas ( e.g becoming a star on youtube ). although most models are applicable to all fields of design ( e.g fashion, product, graphic design ) and some even to art practice, the main focus is on interaction design ( especially the research section ).

PS one of the reasons for compiling this document is to question the dominant designer-client relationship model and if it should be taken for granted as such.

## as service ( dienstleistung )

- working for clients ( the classic model ) ( e.g communicating client interests, product developement, performing )

- *make* and selling one-offs or editions on platforms ( e.g etsy or Digital Media Studio Industries )
- product and project developement via crowd funding ( e.g kickstarter, indiegogo )
- selling ideas as a thinktank ( e.g design fictions like [Julian Bleeker](https://julianbleecker.com) )
- alternative models ( very rare e.g youtube-star )

## as cultural production

- public cultural funding
- private cultural funding ( e.g holweg stiftung )
- cultural funding via companies and corporations ( e.g volkswagen-stiftung )

- paid exhibitions
- curator for exhibitions ( e.g in institutions, at festivals )

- joining *unions* ( or similar ) to get access to *cultural funding* ( e.g *becoming* a composer to get access to music funding )

- as part of a research consortium ( e.g EU project )
- applied and industry-related research ( see service e.g commissioned research, product developement )
- grants for individual research ( e.g study, disseration, or post doc grants )
- selling design journalism + design knowledge ( e.g publishing in magazins )
